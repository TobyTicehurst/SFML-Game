Possibly need texture coordinates to go along with the texture when multiple textures are combined into one
For example, the button texture contains a normal and a clicked button texture. The button class could store one texture ref but 2 sets of texture coordinates.
Texture coordinates would define the top left and bottom right corners of each sub-texture.
Create a class which handles this?
